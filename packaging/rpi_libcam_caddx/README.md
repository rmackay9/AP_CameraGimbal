# Raspberry Pi + libcamera + CADDX gimbal

The `rpi_libcam_caddx` target runs AP_CameraGimbal on a Raspberry Pi CM4
companion computer with an IMX477 CSI camera and a CADDX gimbal, same as
XFRobot C20-T. It runs alongside [Rpanion-server](https://github.com/stephendade/Rpanion-server), which
keeps ownership of networking and the flight-controller link.

Video is captured with libcamera and encoded by the Pi 4 / CM4 hardware H.264
encoder. A single stream is served at `rtsp://<pi>:8554/video1` and used for
recording, at the main resolution: 1920x1080 (default), 1280x720, 960x540,
854x480, 640x360, 426x240 or 320x180, set by `[stream.main] resolution` and the
`VIDEO_MAIN_RES` parameter, and on the web Parameters page. Smaller sizes need
less bandwidth. The size applies without restarting the camera app, but not
while recording. Its bitrate (default 4096 kbps, 1000 to 20000) and frame
rate (default 30, the most the encoder handles at 1080p; 5 to 30) are
`[stream.main] bitrate_kbps` and `frame_rate` in `camera.ini`, the MAVLink
parameters `VIDEO_MAIN_KBPS` and `VIDEO_MAIN_FPS`, and on the web Parameters
page.
The bitrate applies immediately; the frame rate applies after the camera app
is restarted. The `IMG_*` camera parameters (brightness,
contrast, saturation, exposure compensation, ISO, shutter, metering and white
balance) can be changed from the GCS while streaming.

The web interface is served at `http://<pi>:8080/`. The CADDX gimbal is
controlled over a UART, or through a flight controller's serial passthrough;
see [Gimbal](#gimbal).

Photos are taken from the GCS (including interval capture) or the web
Photos page and saved as JPEGs with GPS metadata under
`/var/lib/ap_cameragimbal/capture`. Their size is set by `[capture]
resolution` (MAVLink parameter `PHOTO_RES`, also on the web Parameters page):

| Setting | Photo | Video during the photo |
|---|---|---|
| `video` (default) | video frame at the main resolution | not interrupted |
| `2028x1520` | 2x2 binned sensor, full field of view | paused about 0.5 s |
| `4056x3040` | full sensor resolution | paused about 0.7 s |

The pauses are for 30 fps video. The first six frames after each photo are
skipped, so at a lower `VIDEO_MAIN_FPS` they last longer: about 0.9 to 1.0 s at
15 fps for the full-size photo.

The larger sizes switch the sensor mode and back, holding the exposure and
white balance of the last video frame, so they match the video's brightness
and colour. A 4056x3040 photo takes about 0.7 s in all, so interval capture
at one photo per second works. RTSP viewers see a frozen frame. Recordings
skip the paused frames: the MP4 plays continuously and is shorter than the
real time by the pauses. Photos are taken one at a time: while one is being
taken (up to about 0.7 s, or about 2 s if the capture fails) the camera app
handles no other MAVLink messages, so later requests and gimbal commands wait
until it is saved.

Not yet supported: zoom and overlays. A Pi 5 / CM5 needs a software encoder,
which is not implemented yet.

## Build

On the Pi (Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or later):

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git python3 libcamera-dev libjpeg-dev pkg-config curl unzip
git submodule update --init --recursive
make dependencies
make rpi_libcam_caddx
make rpi_rclone
```

The binaries are `camera_app/build/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera-app` and
`web/rpi_libcam_caddx-web`. `make rpi_rclone` fetches the pinned rclone used by
[cloud upload](#cloud-upload) (a 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS is needed) and checks its
SHA-256; the result is `build/deps/rclone/rclone`.

## Install

```sh
sudo install -m 755 camera_app/build/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera-app /usr/local/bin/ap-camera-app
sudo install -m 755 web/rpi_libcam_caddx-web /usr/local/bin/ap-camera-web
sudo install -D -m 644 -t /usr/local/share/ap_cameragimbal/webroot web/webroot/*.*
sudo install -D -m 644 packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/camera.ini /etc/ap_cameragimbal/camera.ini
sudo install -m 644 packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/ap-cameragimbal.service \
    packaging/rpi_libcam_caddx/ap-cameragimbal-web.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo install -D -m 755 build/deps/rclone/rclone /usr/local/lib/ap_cameragimbal/rclone
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ap-cameragimbal ap-cameragimbal-web
journalctl -u ap-cameragimbal -f
```

Only one process can use the camera, so leave Rpanion-server's video
streaming stopped.

To update, `git pull`, rebuild (including `make rpi_rclone`, which only downloads
rclone again when its pinned version changes), repeat the first three install
commands and the rclone one, and run
`sudo systemctl restart ap-cameragimbal ap-cameragimbal-web`. Installing
`camera.ini` again replaces any settings changed from the GCS or web page.

## Web interface

Browse to `http://<pi>:8080/` (for example `http://10.0.2.100:8080/` over
Rpanion-server's WiFi access point) and log in as `admin` with password
`ardupilot`; the first start writes it to `/etc/ap_cameragimbal/web.pass`.
Change it on the Users page.

The Live tab plays the camera's video in the browser, the Parameters page
edits `/etc/ap_cameragimbal/camera.ini`, the Debug tab shows the camera
service's journal, and the file browser covers recordings under
`/var/lib/ap_cameragimbal`. Restarting the camera app stops it and lets
systemd start it again; Reboot reboots the Pi. Firmware upload is not offered.
The web page sends its camera controls to camera-app's MAVLink TCP port
(`[mavlink] tcp_port`, 14570).

## MAVLink

The camera listens for MAVLink on UDP port 14570. In Rpanion-server's
Flight Controller page, add a UDP output to `127.0.0.1:14570` so mavlink-router
forwards traffic between the flight controller, the GCS and the camera.

Behind mavlink-router the camera cannot tell which network the GCS is on, so
by default the RTSP address it advertises in `VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION` is a
guess: an address on 192.168.144.0/24 if the Pi has one (the usual SIYI/MT11
camera subnet), otherwise the numerically lowest non-loopback IPv4 address.
When the Pi has more than one network, for example Ethernet to the flight
controller and WiFi to the GCS, set the URI the GCS can reach in the web
interface under Parameters → Network → Video stream 1 URI (`[network]
video1_uri` in `camera.ini`), a complete `rtsp://` or `rtsps://` URI such as
`rtsp://10.0.0.5:8554/video1`. It is sent to the GCS as is, so it can also set a
different port, a host name or an extra path; a blank value goes back to the
guess. The camera does not check that it serves the path you give: to serve an
extra path, set `alias` under `[stream.main]` as well. Credentials are not
allowed in the URI. It applies without restarting the camera app, but a GCS
that has already read the stream information may need to reconnect.

If the flight controller runs ArduPilot with a MAVLink camera (`CAM1_TYPE` 6),
it keeps its own copy of the camera's stream information and serves that to
the GCS alongside the camera's reply. In testing, with ArduPilot 4.8.0 it kept
serving the old URI after the setting was changed, so the GCS showed the old
address until the flight controller was rebooted.

`CAMERA_APP_VIDEO_ADDRESS` is no longer used. Move any address to the video stream 1 URI
setting and delete its `video-address.conf` systemd drop-in.

## Gimbal

The CADDX gimbal uses the protocol of ArduPilot's `AP_Mount_CADDX` driver
(115200 8N1). It sends no feedback, so the attitude reported to the GCS is the
commanded target. Nothing is sent to the gimbal until the first gimbal command.
Set the link with `CAMERA_APP_UART`, for example with a systemd drop-in:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d
printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=CAMERA_APP_UART=/dev/ttyAMA0\n' |
    sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ap-cameragimbal.service.d/gimbal-uart.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ap-cameragimbal
```

Without `CAMERA_APP_UART` no gimbal is advertised: camera-app sends no gimbal
heartbeat or `GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION` and reports gimbal device ID 0 in
`CAMERA_INFORMATION`, so a gimbal connected to the flight controller is not
duplicated.

When the gimbal is wired to the flight controller instead, ArduPilot's serial
passthrough can forward it to the Pi over Ethernet. For a gimbal on SERIAL3
and network port 2 as a UDP server:

```
NET_P2_TYPE = 2         (UDP server; reboot after setting)
NET_P2_PORT = 15002
NET_P2_PROTOCOL = -1
SERIAL_PASS1 = 3        (SERIAL3, keeping SERIAL3_BAUD = 115)
SERIAL_PASS2 = 22       (network ports are numbered from 21)
SERIAL_PASSTIMO = -1    (no timeout, kept across reboots)
```

then use `CAMERA_APP_UART=udp://<flight controller IP>:15002`. While
passthrough is active ArduPilot's own mount driver cannot reach the gimbal;
set `MNT1_TYPE = 0` so only the camera reports the gimbal.

## Environment variables

- `CAMERA_APP_RPI_CAMERA`: libcamera camera ID (default: first camera).
- `CAMERA_APP_RPI_ENCODER`: V4L2 H.264 encoder device (default `/dev/video11`).
- `CAMERA_APP_UART`: gimbal link, a serial device or `udp://IPv4:PORT`.
- `CAMERA_APP_RCLONE`, `CAMERA_APP_RCLONE_CONFIG`: the rclone executable (default
  `/usr/local/lib/ap_cameragimbal/rclone`) and its config file (default
  `/var/lib/ap_cameragimbal/rclone.conf`) used by cloud upload. If you change
  `CAMERA_APP_RCLONE_CONFIG`, set it in both the camera and the web service
  units: the web page saves the credentials to that file and rclone reads it.

## Cloud upload

The camera app can copy photos and recordings to your own Google Drive with
[rclone](https://rclone.org/), which the package bundles. It is off by default. You provide your own Google credentials, so no
credentials of ours are involved; this takes about ten minutes, once.

Uploads run only while the camera is **not recording** and the vehicle is
**not armed**, and stop at once when either changes, so they never compete with
the video or the flight. With no flight controller connected the vehicle counts
as disarmed, so a camera on the bench uploads; once a flight controller has
been seen, a heartbeat lost for 5 s counts as armed. Photos go to
`<folder>/photos` and recordings to `<folder>/recordings`; files being written
(`*.part`, `*.tmp`) are skipped. A failed upload is retried after 30 s, then 60 s,
then every 2 minutes. The camera app looks for new files every
`scan_minutes`, when recording ends and when the vehicle disarms. rclone runs at
the lowest CPU and disk priority.

### Create the Google credentials

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) create a
   project (any name).
2. **APIs & Services > Library**: search for "Google Drive API" and enable it.
3. **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**: choose **External**, fill in the
   app name and your email, and add your Google account as a test user. Then
   click **Publish app** so its status is "In production". If it stays in
   "Testing", Google expires the token after 7 days and uploads stop. An
   unverified personal app shows a warning when you sign in; continue past it.
4. **APIs & Services > Credentials > Create credentials > OAuth client ID**:
   application type **Desktop app**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client
   secret**.
5. On a computer with a web browser [install rclone](https://rclone.org/install/)
   and run

   ```sh
   rclone authorize "drive" "CLIENT_ID" "CLIENT_SECRET"
   ```

   Sign in and allow access. rclone prints a line starting with `{` (the
   token) between "Paste the following..." and "End paste". Copy that line.
6. On the web Parameters page open the **Cloud Upload** tab, enter the client
   ID, client secret and token under *Google Drive credentials* and click **Save
   credentials**. They are stored in `/var/lib/ap_cameragimbal/rclone.conf`,
   readable only by root, and are never shown again.
7. Set *Remote and folder* to `gdrive:AP_CameraGimbal` (the folder is created),
   choose what to upload and what happens to the local copy, set *Upload to
   cloud* to Enabled and save. The settings apply without a restart, and the
   *Upload status* on the same tab shows what is happening.

The token allows whatever access you approved when signing in, which for
rclone's default is all the files in that Google account's Drive. If that
matters, use a Google account just for the camera. Remove the credentials on the
same tab, or revoke access at <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions>.

`after_upload` chooses what happens to a file once it is uploaded and checked:
`keep` it, `delete` it, or `delete_when_low`: a check that starts with free space
below `low_space_percent` deletes every file it uploads (not just enough to get
back above the limit), and other checks keep them. Deleting is done by rclone
only after it has verified the upload. `bandwidth_kib_s` limits the speed in
KiB/s.
